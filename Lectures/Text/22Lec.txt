Preserving state/synchronizing across a distributed system: ACID
	-> Atomicity: Update either happens or does not

	-> Consistency: System invariants are preserved
		- Read: Data does not change "magically" - on read, no one else will change the value you have until you are done using it
		- Write: Data does not change "magically" - on write, no one will change the value you have written until you are done using it

	-> Isolation: One update does not change another (concurrently happening)

	-> Durability: Once written, an update does not disappear
