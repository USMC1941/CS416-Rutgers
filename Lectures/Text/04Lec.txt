Memory Mapping
	- Have some memory address that don't map to main memory, but instead map to other stuff (devices)
Abstracting hardware/devices - Why?
	- Unify instructions to talk to it
		- User does not need to know how to speak to the device that uses it
	- Put addresses that map to devices in OS-land ... USR can only access them though OS

Device Access:
	- PIO vs. DMA
	- PIO
		- Low/no set up time
		- Each operation is fairly quick, but needs many
	- DMA
		- Medium/high set up time
		- Operation is EXTREMELY fast once started, need only one (or very few)

Polled vs. Interrupt
	- Polled
		- Fairly quick, but if an event takes a long time to occur... burning lots of cycles by just checking
	- Interrupt
		- Fairly expensive, but can notify asynchronously.
