File Systems:
Resolving representation and realities of storage

physicality ... matters
- alter the way that representations are encoded to exploit behavior of the underlying mechanisms

contiguous - nice to read/write
					.. but .. incurs fragmentation issues

linked - no fragmentation issues (at least external)
	      - but ... lose benefits of random access that in-order sequential storage breeds
				 .... and ... working against the physicality of HDD

:^(
--> there is nothing about linked allocation that is mutually exclusive with contiguous
 ... contiguity is a feature of location/allocation
 ... linking is a feature of organization/addressing

indexing - store all metadata in one place rather than seeking from block to block to find it
			... can restore a measure of random access to structures that had been linked
			... necessarily requires more space/two lookups
