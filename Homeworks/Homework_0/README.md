  <li>You have two numbers, A and B. 
  
  Using bitwise operations and loops, write code to determine how many bits must be flipped in order to turn A in to B.</li>

e.g.

A: 101001

B: 10**01**01

Answer: 2 bits

  <li>Presume you have an implementation of Quicksort that picks the first element in a list as its pivot. 
  
  Construct a list of 13 numbers that would make this algorithm run in O(n^2) time.</li>
  
 
  <li>Write code to solve the below in O(n) time with one pass over the array. If you can not, provide your best code and state the asymptotic running time.</li>
  
  * In this challenge, given an array of integers, the goal is to efficiently find the subarray that has the greatest positive value when all of its elements are summed together.
  * Write some code that, if given an array of integers, will find the subarray that has the greatest sum. A subarray is a contiguous subset of the original array.
  * Keep in mind the maximal subarray is not necessary a proper subset, and might contain the whole original array.
    * Be careful. Some array elements may be negative, so less can be more.
    * If all the elements in an array are negative, the maximal sum should be null as we are interested in the greatest positive value, not the greatest arithmetic value.
 * For example: Given the array: `{1, 2, -5, 4, -3, 2}`
    * The maximum sum of a subarray is 4 and it contains only the element 4.
 * Before you write the code, take some time to think of the most efficient solution possible; it may surprise you. The major goal of this question is to test your algorithmic skills rather than merely your ability to write code quickly.

  <li>RE pattern matching. 

  Draw an NFA (nondeterministic finite state automata) that recognizes the same language that the regular expression `((A*B | C )* | D )`</li>


  <li>Are there any preferences you have for grouping?</li>
