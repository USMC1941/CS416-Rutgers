## Course Overview

* CS 416 is a senior undergraduate course in operating systems. 

* We will cover the basic concepts in operating systems, such as processes, threads, virtual memory, file systems, and communication protocols. 

* We may also cover a few interesting research topics. 

* For the programming assignments, we will be using C.

## Pre-requisites

* Students must have taken an undergraduate courses in Systems Programming and Computer Architecture. 

* These pre-requisites translate into CS 214 (which itself requires an undergraduate course in computer architecture, such as CS 211) OR the combination of ECE 331 and ECE 351.

* The programming assignments require good programming skills and a lot of time and effort. 

* Note that these requirements are very serious; you will not be able to keep up with this course's load, if you don't have the suggested background, programming skills, and time. 

* Even if you do have the background and the skills, the course can require lots of technical research and reading for the programming assignments, so come very motivated!

## Evaluation

* 20% Midterm
* 60% Homeworks and Programming Assignments
* 20% Final Exam

## Cheating Policy

* Exams and written homeworks in CS 416 must be strictly individual work. 

* Programming assignments will be done in groups of 3 or 4 students. 

* Collaboration with other groups on programming assignments is encouraged at the level of ideas. 

* Feel free to ask each other questions, brainstorm on algorithms, or work together at a blackboard. 
  * You should not, however, copy the actual code for programming assignments, or copy the wording for written homeworks. 
  * This will be considered cheating and will be punished severely! 
  * Please review the CS department's cheating policy to be sure you do not have difficulties.
