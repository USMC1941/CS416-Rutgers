Scheduling:
FIFO
RR

SJF
SRTF

priority
lag time to run short jobs
starvation


RR - vary quantum to approx FIFO or SJF

- have mutliple ... i.e. multilevel feedback

handle starvation by increasing priority based on wait time ... 
  .. eventually even the lowest priority task will bubble up to be highest after not being run long enough
  
prioity inversion - when low pri proc gets its runtime it locks something a high pri proc will need... so high pri must wait on low pri
