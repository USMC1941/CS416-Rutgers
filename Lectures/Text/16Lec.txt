Drive Access:
FCFS
	+ easy to write
	- st00pid (FIFO ... qed)

SSTF
	+ good average seek time/response time
	- may starve out some longer operations
	(fairly natural appeal/common)

C-SCAN
	+ Do SCAN until hitting maximal (or minimal end), then immediately return to other side without servicing requests along the way
	- low(er) MTTF (Mean Time to Failure), but significantly better worst cases

SCAN (elevator algorithm)
	+ high(er) MTTF
	- higher average wait due to bad worst cases

C-LOOK
	+ Do SCAN until servicing maximal request in one direction, then reverse
	- somewhat lower MTTF, but better worst cases (lower average access)
