Stateful/Stateless
	-> Stateful
		- Remember stuff
		- Smaller messages
		- Send more often
		- Optimizations
		- More fragile
	-> Stateless
		- Little/no memory
		- Larger messages
		- Send less often
		- Future is a mystery
		- More robust (can reboot because no metadata)

Ghosts
	-> Replications of state
	-> Voting with... to forum a quorum...
		- If you can form a read quorum with ghosts, then nodes that come back up cam resynchronize by reading all resources

DNS
	-> Root: edu, com, org, ...
	-> Top-level: rutgers, google, att, ...
	-> Authoritative: math, cs, www, ...
	-> Non-authoritative: Cached locally (or close by)

Namespace
	-> Named list of names that they themselves may be duplicates of other names, but do not collide as the two lists have different top-level outward-facing names

UDP vs. TCP
	-> Flow control: Give RCVR some mechanism to adjust rate of send
	-> Reliable delivery: Require RCVR to send ACK (acknowledgment) message on received
	-> Retransmission: Resend missed messages on timeout
	-> Congestion control: Throttle send based on network capacity (rate of slowest link)


Circuit Switching (DMA, interrupt driven I/O, stateful)
	-> Longer set up time
	-> Fast/dedicated transmission once it's set up

Packet Switching (PIO, polled I/O, stateless)
	-> Short/no set up time
	-> Slower/contention/shared transmission for each chunk


OSI Protocols

Transport
	TCP: Stateful
	UDP: Stateless

Network
	IP: Stateless(ish)

Data link
	Stateful (802.11, 802.3, 802.15.4)

PHY
	Stateless(ish)
	GSM (More stateful)
