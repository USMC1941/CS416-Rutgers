RAID

Logical vs. Physical organization
	- Logical: Software representation
	- Physical: Hardware


1 to M ... M to 1 ... M to M


Multiple physical to 1 logical drive... organizations thereof
	1. Resilience (can be practically implemented using redundancy)
	0. Performance (bandwidth is multiplicative)

RAID:
0. Striping (100% Performance)
1. Mirroring (100% Resilience)
2. 1-bit striping and ECC (log_2(n) check disks, rest for performance)
3. 1-bit striping and XOR disk (1 check disk)
4. RAID3, but wider stripes
5. RAID4, but interleave check stripes across disks to amortize writes
6. RAID5, but with offset XORs for additional redundancy and to preserve the XOR relation across all corresponding stripes

SCSI
PCI

open:
fd > 0: can read/write from/to it
fd == -1: can not read/write from/to it

read(fd, buf, 10);
read(fd, buf, 10);
