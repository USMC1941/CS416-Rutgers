IO:

(virtualize a device as a memory location)

IO space is heterogenous like all crazy ...

one abstraction to rule them all - file descriptors...
- open
- close
- read
- write

blocking and non-blocking:
blocking: program is either not scheduled or only NO-OPs when scheduled
non-blocking: program (function) returns immediately (with status info) when next scheduled - will not allow a timeslice to pass

synchronous and asynchronous:
sync: does not return until device has completed operation
async: returns immediately, and operation is completed at some point in the future, process is signalled when operation is complete

buffered and non-buffered:
buffer: copy data to some intermediate memory
non-buffered: ... don't


read(fd, buf, 10);
