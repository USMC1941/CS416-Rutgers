Scheduling
	- FIFO
	- Round Robin
	- Shortest Job First (SJF)
	- Shortest Run Time First (SRTF)

Priority
Lag time to run short jobs
Starvation

RR
	- Vary quantum to approximate FIFO or SJF
	- Have multiple... i.e. multilevel feedback

Handle starvation by increasing priority based on wait time...
... eventually even the lowest priority task will bubble up to be highest after not being run long enough

Priority Inversion
	- When low priority process gets its runtime, it may lock something a high priority process will need... so high priority must wait on low priority
