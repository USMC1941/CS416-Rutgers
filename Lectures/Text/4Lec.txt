I/O stuff (story time)

Memory Mapping
- have some memory addresses that do not map to main memory, but instead map to other stuff (devices)
?: abstracting hardware/devices ... why?
- unify instructions to talk to it
	- user does not need to know how to speak to the device in order to use it
- put addresses that map to devices in OS-land ... USR can only access them through OS (it's a trap!)


Device Access:
PIO v. DMA
PIO: - low/no set up time
		- each operation is fairly quick, but need many
DMA: - medium/high set up time
			- operation is EXTREMELY fast once started, need only one (or very few)

Polled v. Interrupt
Poll: fairly quick, but if event takes a long time to occur .. burning lots of cycles just checking
Interrupt: fairly expensive, but can notify asynchronously
